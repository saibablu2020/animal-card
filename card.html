			<p>The Koala Inroduction The koala is the Australian jewel. It has very furry, ash colored hair, a rubbery black nose, sharp claws, fuzzy ears, and a grizzly personality, or should I say, koalality. If you kill a koala, you'll make a million off their fur. They would sell the fur to coat companies and make coats out of koala fur. Well, sadly enough, too many people are making millions on koalas.</p>
